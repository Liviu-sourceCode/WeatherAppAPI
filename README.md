# Weather App API

## Project Overview
**Weather App API** is a web project that provides real-time weather data through an API. The data is fetched and displayed on an interactive interface based on the city entered by the user.

## Main Features
- **User Interface**: Intuitive interface for viewing weather data provided by the API.
- **City Input**: Users can enter a city name in a text box and press the 'Get Weather' button to receive essential weather information.
- **Error Handling**: The application handles cases where:
  - No city is entered in the text box.
  - The entered city name is misspelled.
  - The city does not exist.
  - Specific alerts and messages are displayed for each of these scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing the user interface.
- **API**: Utilized an Application Programming Interface (API) to generate and fetch weather data.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for hosting and versioning the code.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me understand what an API is and how to integrate it into a web application. By creating an application that provides weather information, I was able to put into practice the knowledge I have accumulated in web development and API integration.
